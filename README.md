# Vitruv.io

Simple GUI that anyone can use in order to decide if maybe they need to "bite the bullet" and go see a doctor.

Interface utilizes SVG's facilitating mouseover on specific body parts, which then query our database for symptoms
related to those areas, and when checked, return possible "diagnoses".  

Not to be used in place of professional medical advice.
